Description: The TMSig package contains tools to prepare, analyze, and visualize
    named lists of mathematical sets, with an emphasis on molecular signatures
    (such as gene or kinase sets). It includes fast, memory efficient functions
    to construct sparse incidence and similarity matrices and filter, cluster, 
    invert, and decompose sets. Additionally, bubble heatmaps can be created to 
    visualize the results of any differential or molecular signatures analysis.
