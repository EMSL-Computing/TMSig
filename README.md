ostRich contains tools to operate on sets, and it was originally
intended for the preparation of biomolecular/-omics sets for enrichment
analysis/gene set testing/biomolecular set testing. Examples of
biomolecular sets: Reactome pathways, Gene Ontology gene sets,
phosphorylation sites grouped by their known kinases, and
metabolites/lipids grouped by chemical subclasses (e.g., acyl
carnitines, fatty acids). **In general, the functions in this package
work with any named list of character vectors.**

Below is a growing list of what can be accomplished with this package:

- `gmt_to_list`: Create a named list of gene sets from a GMT file.

- `incidence`: Compute a sparse incidence matrix with unique sets as
  rows and unique elements as columns. A value of 1 indicates that a
  particular element is a member of that set, while a value of 0
  indicates that it is not. This serves as the cornerstone of several
  other functions. The cross-product of the incidence matrix with its
  transpose will yield the sizes of the pairwise intersections of each
  set on the off-diagonals and the sizes of the sets on the diagonal.

- `similarity`: Compute all pairwise Jaccard or overlap similarity
  coefficients. The Jaccard coefficient, $J$, is defined as the
  cardinality of the intersection of two sets divided by the cardinality
  of their union. The overlap coefficient is defined as the cardinality
  of the intersection divided by the cardinality of the smallest set.

- `filter_sets`: optionally restrict sets to only those elements in a
  pre-determined `background` and only keep those sets passing minimum
  and maximum size thresholds. In practice, biomolecular sets are
  restricted to the biomolecules measured in a particular experiment
  (the background).

- `cluster_sets`: hierarchical clustering of highly similar sets. In
  practice, a single biomolecular set from each cluster would be
  selected to serve as that clusterâ€™s representative for enrichment
  analysis. Redundant sets would be discarded or reported separately
  (preferred).

- `decompose_sets`: decompose all pairs of sets into 3 disjoint
  components: the elements unique to set 1, the elements unique to set
  2, and the elements shared by both sets. Not currently used in
  practice.

## Installation

You can install the development version of ostRich like so:

``` r
if (!require("devtools", quietly = TRUE))
  install.packages("devtools")

devtools::install_github("EMSL-Computing/ostRich")
```

## Examples

``` r
library(ostRich)

          "Set2" = letters[1:4], # subset of Set1
          "Set3" = letters[1:4], # aliased with Set2
          "Set4" = letters[1:3], # subset of Set1-Set3
          "Set5" = c("a", "a", NA), # duplicates and NA
          "Set6" = c("x", "y", "z"), # distinct elements
