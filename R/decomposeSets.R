#' @title Decompose Pairs of Overlapping Sets Into 3 Disjoint Parts
#'
#' @description Decompose all pairs of sufficiently overlapping sets into 3
#'   disjoint parts: the elements unique to the first set, the elements unique
#'   to the second set, and the elements found in both sets. See the examples
#'   section in \code{\link{invertSets}} for a method to decompose an entire
#'   list of sets.
#'
#' @inheritParams incidence
#' @param overlap integer; only pairs of sets with at least \code{overlap}
#'   elements in common will be decomposed.
#' @param AND character; string used to denote the intersection of two sets.
#'   Defaut is "~AND~", which produces intersections of the form "A ~AND~ B"
#'   (i.e., elements in both A and B).
#' @param MINUS character; string used to denote the difference of two sets.
#'   Defualt is "~MINUS~", which produces differences of the form "A ~MINUS~ B"
#'   (i.e., elements in A and not in B).
#' @param verbose logical; whether to print warnings and messages.
#'
#' @section Optimization:
#'
#'   Since the size of the intersection between two sets is at most the size of
#'   the smaller set, any sets with fewer than \code{overlap} elements can be
#'   immediately discarded.
#'
#' @source Decomposition of sets is described by Jiang and Gentleman (2007) in
#'   section 2.3.1 "Overlap among gene sets". It is a method to reduce the
#'   redundancy of significant gene set testing results whereby the decomposed
#'   sets are reanalyzed and the following selections can be made:
#'
#' \itemize{
#'   \item{If the elements unique to set 1 and set 2, elements common to both
#'   sets, or all 3 parts are statistically significant, keep both set 1 and set
#'   2 in the original results. We can not separate their effects.}
#'
#'   \item{If the elements unique to set 1 or the elements unique to set 1 and
#'   common to both sets are statistically significant, only keep set 1 in the
#'   original results. (The same logic can be applied for set 2.)}
#' }
#'
#' @returns A named list of disjoint parts of sets. May contain aliases.
