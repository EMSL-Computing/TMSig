#' @title Decompose pairs of overlapping sets into 3 disjoint parts
#'
#' @description `r lifecycle::badge("experimental")`
#'
#'   Decompose all pairs of sufficiently overlapping sets into 3 disjoint parts:
#'   the elements unique to the first set, the elements unique to the second
#'   set, and the elements found in both sets.
#'
#' @inheritParams incidence
#' @param overlap integer; only pairs of sets with at least
#'   \code{overlap} elements in common will be decomposed.
#'
#' @section Optimization:
#'
#'   Since the size of the intersection between two sets is at most the size of
#'   the smaller set, any sets with fewer than \code{overlap} elements can be
#'   immediately discarded.
#'
#' @source Decomposition of sets is described by Jiang and Gentleman (2007) in
#'   section 2.3.1 "Overlap among gene sets". It is a method to reduce the
#'   redundancy of significant gene set testing results whereby the decomposed
#'   sets are reanalyzed and the following selections can be made:
#'
#' \itemize{
#'   \item{If the elements unique to set 1 and set 2, elements common to both
#'   sets, or all 3 parts are statistically significant, keep both set 1 and set
#'   2 in the original results. We can not separate their effects.}
#'
#'   \item{If the elements unique to set 1 or the elements unique to set 1 and
#'   common to both sets are statistically significant, only keep set 1 in the
#'   original results. (The same logic can be applied for set 2.)}
#' }
#'
#' @returns A list of disjoint parts of sets. May contain aliases.
